When working with objects that have relationships with each other, We have two ways of handling such relationship:

1.  References(Normalization)
2.  Embedded Documents(Denormalization)
3.  Hybrid

The usages of these two is a trade off between query performance vs consistency.

# Using Relationships

When we have documents that have relations to each other, for example when we have a document that holds an instance of another document, we can do this:

## Models

Our `schema2`has an instance in `schema1`

***schema2.js***

```JS
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const schema2Schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 5,
        maxlength: 50
    }
});

const Schema2 = mongoose.model('Schema2', schema2Schema);


exports.schema2Schema = schema2Schema;
exports.Schema2 = Schema2;
```

Note that we also export `schema2Schema` and not just the model `Schema2`. You will now see how this helps in `schema1`:

***schema1.js***

```JS
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { schema2Schema } = require('./schema2.js')

const schema1Schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true,
        minlength: 3,
        maxlength: 255
    },
    schema2: {
        type: schema2Schema, 
        required: true
    },
});

const Schema1 = mongoose.model('Schema1', schema1Schema);

exports.Schema1 = Schema1;
```

## Routes

Now in our route definitions, in `POST` and `PUT` requests, the client ***MUST*** send the `schema2`'s ID. Because we will use the given ID to link the `schema2` object inside `schema1`.

```JS
// Inside POST request
app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
const schema2 = await Schema2.findById(req.body.schema2Id);
    if (!schema2) return res.status(400).send('Schema2 invalid!');

    let schema1 = new Schema1({
        title: req.body.title,
        schema2: {
            _id: schema2._id,
            name: schema2.name
        }
    });

    schema1 = await schema1.save();

    console.log(`post schema1 with id: ${schema1._id}`);
    res.send(schema1);
});
```

***NOTE***: Here we have the ID of the needed document, but we can only store the needed properties inside our document. This way we will have the needed properties at hand instead of having a get request to fetch the needed properties.
