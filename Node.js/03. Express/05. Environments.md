# Environments

When in an enterprise application, we need to know what environment our code is running on.
Is it a development environment or a production environment?
We might want to enable or disable certain feature. for example we might want to enable logging only in development.

## NODE_ENV

The `process` object is a global object in node that gives us access to the current process.
We have an environment variable in every process called `NODE_ENV`. It return the environment for our node application.
If it is not set we will get `undefined`.
Another method to get the current environment is through the `app` object:
`app.get('env')`
This method internally gets the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable.
***Note***: When using the `app` object to get the environment, if it is not set, by default it will return 'development'.

```javascript
console.log(`Current env: ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);
console.log(`app: ${app.get('env')}`);
```

and the console will return:

```
Current env: undefined
app: development
```

## Different features for each environment

we can enable a certain feature for each environment like this:

```javascript
if(app.get('env') === 'development'){
    // Enable features here
    // Example:
    app.use(morgan('tiny'));
    console.log('Morgan enabled...');
}
```

We can change the environment by changing `NODE_ENV` using the export command in terminal.
