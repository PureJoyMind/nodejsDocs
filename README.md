# nodejs Docs
These are my personal documents which I have written when watching or reading new stuff about nodejs. 
They start from the beginning of nodejs and have an order.
You can use these if you want to recollect your existing data and need a refresher.

## Sources
The main source of these notes is Mosh Hamedani's course. I highly recommend it because he covers all the usefull data needed to deliver real world projects.

## which Version?
These informations are versionless and are the core concepts of nodejs. 

***
It took considerable time writing these. use them to your liking!
